### Abstract 
Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) manages the Rocky Reach and Rock Island Dams along the Columbia River. The operation of these dams relies on controls that monitor inflow and outflow to optimize energy production efficiency and promote environmental sustainability. Currently, Chelan PUD utilizes linear gradient models for these controls, which fall short of addressing the river's hydrodynamic conditions. This project focuses on the challenge of accurately predicting inflow and headwater elevation levels to effectively distribute water to each dam to match electricity demand for energy production and usage. Utilizing extensive data from 2019 to 2023, the proposed solution involved machine learning approaches using Principal Components Analysis and Time Series Modeling. This approach also investigated the influence of external factors, weather, and energy pricing on headwater elevation for both dams. Results showed that headwater elevations are most influenced by discharge from upstream dams rather than upstream river flows. The models showed improvements for variables being influenced by the model from 20% to 99.6%. This initiative represents a significant step towards optimizing dam operations amidst the ever-changing hydrologic scenarios of the Columbia River.
